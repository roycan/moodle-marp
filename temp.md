Conclusion: The study presents encouraging evidence that AI Coding Assistants can be integrated into programming education to scaffold learning for novices, potentially broadening participation in computing.

What does the paper say that's related to how students can learn programming better with AI?

The paper highlights several ways AI code generators can enhance how students learn programming:

   *  Improved Performance with AI Assistance: Students using AI code generators like Codex showed significant improvements in coding tasks. They completed tasks faster and with higher correctness scores, suggesting that AI assistance can make learning programming more efficient and effective.
   * Retention and Understanding: The study found that learners with prior access to Codex performed slightly better in evaluation tests conducted a week later. This indicates that AI code generators could potentially aid in the retention of programming concepts.
   * Benefit for Students with Prior Programming Knowledge: Students with higher pre-test scores and access to Codex performed significantly better in retention tests. This suggests that AI code generators can be particularly useful for students who already have some programming knowledge, helping them to transition this knowledge more effectively into new programming languages or environments.
   * Reduced Stress and Increased Eagerness: Qualitative feedback from the study indicates that students using Codex felt less stressed and more eager to continue learning programming. This suggests that AI code generators can create a more positive learning experience, potentially increasing student engagement and persistence in programming education.
   * Learning from Generated Code: The paper suggests that the ability to generate, modify, and interact with AI-generated code provides a unique learning opportunity. Students can learn from examining and understanding the generated code, then applying this understanding in subsequent tasks.
   * Promotes Subgoal Learning: Some students used Codex to break tasks into subgoals and generate code for each subgoal step by step. This approach aligns with educational strategies that emphasize breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, facilitating learning by reducing cognitive load.


In summary, the paper posits that AI code generators can support novice learners in introductory programming by improving performance, aiding retention, reducing stress, and providing opportunities for active learning through interaction with AI-generated code.
